## June 29th:

- I created a working create user endpoint without authentication, to demonstrate my ability to use FastAPI and PostgreSQL. FastAPI is a lot different than Django but it seems easy to use once you get used to it. Little did I know about the problems I would face regarding migrations when updating the user table to include role and hashed password.

## June 30th:

- I created a working update user endpoint for the first users table. I will need to update it once we implement authentication.

## July 10-14th:

- I worked on signup and authorization but was unable to finish by wednesday night. I was out of class due to family matters on thursday and friday, but my team was able to implement authorization while I was gone and were supportive as I was out of town.

## July 17th-20th:

-I worked on the UserProfile page, worked on bugs with frontend authorization, and updated the account table this week to include a bootcamp and picture field. Joshua implemented an edit user endpoint that we will use to enhance the user profile page.

## July 24th -28th:

- Joshua and I worked on the User Profile and Edit User page together. We had an issue where the user information would not be updated in userData on the front end until the user logged out and back in. We decided that our handleEdit function would also log out the user, so when the user logs back in their information will be up to date. We also finalized our project this week and did a presentation with Rosheen for grading purposes.
